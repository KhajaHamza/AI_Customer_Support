#### **Bug Resolution**:
- **Functionality**: Assist engineers in quickly diagnosing and resolving bugs. Analyze error logs, suggest potential fixes, and provide code snippets to correct issues.
- **Example Interaction**:
  - **User Query**: "I'm getting a null pointer exception in my Java application. How do I fix this?"
  - **Assistant Response**: "A null pointer exception occurs when your code tries to use an object reference that hasn't been initialized. To resolve this, check where the object is being assigned and ensure it's properly initialized before use. For example:
    java
    MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Ensure this is not null
    obj.someMethod();
